# rrcad DSL prelude — loaded automatically into every interpreter session.
#
# This file is embedded in the binary (include_str!) and evaluated during
# MrubyVm::new().  Users never need to write `require` or `require_relative`.
#
# After the prelude runs, MrubyVm::new() calls rrcad_register_shape_class()
# which registers native implementations for Shape and all DSL methods.
# Native methods shadow the Ruby stubs below.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Shape — backing class for all solid geometry objects.
#
# Native instances (created via box/cylinder/sphere/rect/circle) are mRuby
# RData objects holding a raw pointer to a heap-allocated Rust Shape.
#
# Stub instances (created via Shape.new for Phase 3+ stub tests) carry
# @kind / @args instance variables; their inspect uses the prelude definition
# until the native override runs.
